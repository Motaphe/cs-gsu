'''
Purpose: 
Calculating whether the integer inputted is a prime number or not. 

Pre-Conditions (input):
The integer to check.

Post-Conditions (output):
Whether the input is a prime number, a non prime number, or a negative number.
'''

## The Design:

# Import the 'isprime' function from the 'sympy' library.


# Define the function which will return whether the input is a prime number, a non prime number
# or a negative number.

    # If the number is less than  0, print that it is a negative number.

    # Else, if the function 'isprime' returns True for the number, print that it is a prime number.

    # Else, if all above cases fail, print that it is a non prime number. 


# Define the main function.    

    # Display the introductory message.

    # Ask the user to input an integer and call the function 'isItPrime' on the number to find the result.
